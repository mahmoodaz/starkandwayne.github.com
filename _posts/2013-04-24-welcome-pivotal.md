Congratulations to all the staff and management at [Pivotal](http://gopivotal.com/ "Home | GoPivotal") who are launching today!

I am very happy to be a partner with Pivotal on all-things related to Cloud Foundry and the future of our industry. They will be great stewards of Cloud Foundry the Open Source project and I look forward to CF becoming pervasive throughout all enterprises and ISP/Cloud companies over the next few years.

You can watch their launch event [right now](http://gopivotal.com/launch "Pivotal Launch Event | GoPivotal")!
